Electric Car Traveler
---------------------
Description:
-> In this project, we are given an electric car that needs to travel from the source city to the destination city via other cities. Given that the car is electric, it needs to be recharged when it is about to reach its total capacity. Each city has an electric charging station where the car can be recharged. The car needs to travel so that the total number of stops should be minimal; however, the car should have enough battery to return to the current city if the charging station of the following city is defective. Initially, the car at the source station is completely charged.

---------------------
Input Variables:
Capacity (capacity) = Total capacity of the car.
The number of cities with their names (list_cities).
Distances between all the cities (list_dist)
---------------------
Output Variables:
The list of cities where the car stopped to recharge its battery (output_list).
